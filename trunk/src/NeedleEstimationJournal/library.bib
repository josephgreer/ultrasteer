abstract = {Visualized freehand 3-D ultrasound reconstruction offers to image incremental reconstruction during acquisition and guide users to scan interactively for high-quality volumes. We originally used the graphics processing unit (GPU) to develop a visualized reconstruction algorithm that achieves real-time level. Each newly acquired image was transferred to the memory of the GPU and inserted into the reconstruction volume on the GPU. The partially reconstructed volume was then rendered using GPU-based incremental ray casting. After visualized reconstruction, hole-filling was performed on the GPU to fill remaining empty voxels in the reconstruction volume. We examine the real-time nature of the algorithm using in vitro and in vivo datasets. The algorithm can image incremental reconstruction at speed of 26-58 frames/s and complete 3-D imaging in the acquisition time for the conventional freehand 3-D ultrasound.},

abstract = {Ultrasound can be used to image perfusion in two ways: the traditional one using Doppler and the more recent using microbubble contrast agents. Doppler is simple to use and inexpensive but is limited to larger vessels with faster flow rates. It cannot interrogate the microvasculature because bulk tissue movement is faster than capillary flow. It has been used for liver and tumour flow. Contrast studies are much richer and can assess both the macro- and microcirculation. One approach analyses the time-intensity curves in a region of interest, e.g. a tumour, myocardium, brain, following bolus i.v. injection. Another approach measures the time taken for the microbubbles to cross a vascular bed of interest. These arrival times can be useful for the liver in both diffuse and focal diseases and for the kidney. Features derived from time-intensity curves following bolus i.v. injections of microbubbles form sensitive early indicators of the vascular response of tumours to antivascular drugs. This approach, known as dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US), has been accepted as a valid technique for monitoring tumour response by several authorities.},

Most standard reconstruction algorithms are designed to minimize computational requirements and do not exploit the underlying shape of the data. We investigate whether an approximation with splines holds any promise as a better reconstruction method. A radial basis function approximation method is implemented and compared with three standard methods. While the radial basis approach is computationally expensive, it produces accurate reconstructions without the kind of visible artefacts common with the standard methods. The other potential advantages of radial basis functions, such as the direct computation of derivatives, make further investigation worthwhile.},

In this paper, we present the first integration of a multiscale volume representation based on tensor approximation within a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multiresolution rendering framework. Specific contributions include (a) a hierarchical brick-tensor decomposition approach for pre-processing large volume data, (b) a GPU accelerated tensor reconstruction implementation exploiting CUDA capabilities, and (c) an effective tensor-specific quantization strategy for reducing data transfer bandwidth and out-of-core memory footprint. Our multiscale representation allows for the extraction, analysis and display of structural features at variable spatial scales, while adaptive level-of-detail rendering methods make it possible to interactively explore large datasets within a constrained memory footprint. The quality and performance of our prototype system is evaluated on large structurally complex datasets, including gigabyte-sized micro-tomographic volumes.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) is increasingly being introduced in the clinic, both for diagnostics and image guidance. Although dedicated 3D US probes exist, 3D US can also be acquired with the still frequently used two-dimensional (2D) US probes. Obtaining 3D volumes with 2D US probes is a two-step process. First, a positioning sensor must be attached to the probe; second, a reconstruction of a 3D volume can be performed into a regular voxel grid. Various algorithms have been used for performing 3D reconstruction based on 2D images. Up till now, a complete overview of the algorithms, the way they work and their benefits and drawbacks due to various applications has been missing. The lack of an overview is made clear by confusions about algorithm and group names in the existing literature. This article is a review aimed at explaining and categorizing the various algorithms into groups, according to algorithm implementation. The algorithms are compared based on published data and our own laboratory results. Positive and practical uses of the various algorithms for different applications are discussed, with a focus on image guidance.},

Using the positions of the irregularly spaced B-scans, a regular 3D lattice volume can be reconstructed, to which conventional 3D computer vision algorithms (registration and segmentation) can be applied. This paper presents a new 3D reconstruction method which explicitly accounts for the probe trajectory.

abstract = {The most attractive feature of 2D B-mode ultrasound for intra-operative use is that it is both a real time and a highly interactive modality. Most 3D freehand reconstruction methods, however, are not fully interactive because they do not allow the display of any part of the 3D ultrasound image until all data collection and reconstruction is finished. We describe a technique whereby the 3D reconstruction occurs in real-time as the data is acquired, and where the operator can view the progress of the reconstruction on three orthogonal slice views through the ultrasound volume. Capture of the ultrasound data can be immediately followed by a straightforward, interactive nonlinear registration of a pre-operative MRI volume to match the intra-operative ultrasound. We demonstrate the our system on a deformable, multi-modal PVA-cryogel phantom and during a clinical surgery.},

Image guided surgery researchers are investigating devices broadly categorized as surgical localizers to provide real-time information on the instrument's 3D location and orientation only. This paper describes the implementation and in vitro evaluation of a prototype real-time nonimaging ultrasound-based catheter localizer system towards use in abdominal aortic aneurysm procedures. The catheter-tip is equipped with a single element ultrasound transducer which is tracked with an array of seven external single element transducers. The performance of the system was evaluated in a water tank and additionally in the presence of pork belly tissue and also a nitinol-dacron stent graft. The mean root mean square errors were respectively 1.94±0.06, 2.54±0.31 and 3.33±0.06 mm. In addition, this paper illustrates errors induced by transducer aperture size and suggests a method for aperture error compensation. Aperture compensation applied to the same experimental data yielded mean root mean square errors of 1.05±0.07, 2.42±0.33 and 3.23±0.07mm respectively for water; water and pork; and water, pork and stent experiments. Lastly, this paper presents a video showing free-hand movement of the catheter within the water tank with data capture at 25 frames per second.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Registration of ultrasound to computed tomography (CT) images is used in several image-guided procedures, including laparoscopic surgery and radiation therapy. Conventional approaches use an external tracker calibrated to the ultrasound transducer and CT system, but several calibration steps are required. Registration can also be performed by aligning image features between modalities, but differences in feature depiction make matching difficult and initial approximate alignment is often needed. Registration using fiducials is a simpler approach but is limited by the need to implant fiducials in the anatomical region of interest so they are visible to both ultrasound and CT. This paper investigates the feasibility of using fiducials near the skin surface, and whether such fiducials can be sufficiently localized in the very near field of a 3D ultrasound transducer without significantly degrading image quality. This approach can also be used as an initialization step for feature-based registration techniques.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A stand-off pad containing fiducials (n > 3) was constructed using polyvinyl chloride and steel ball fiducials that are visible in both 3D ultrasound and CT images. Experiments on phantoms were performed to assess image quality and registration errors. Controlled variables included pad thickness and ultrasound imaging parameters. Initial tests were also conducted of a potential application in partial nephrectomy surgery.

RESULTS: Image quality was degraded by an average of 6-11-13\% (elevational-axial-lateral) in resolution of point targets and 5\% in lesion contrast. Average fiducial localization error was 1.34 mm (axial) to 2.38 mm (lateral and elevational); average fiducial registration error (FRE) was 0.46 mm (axial), 1.08 mm (lateral) and 0.90 mm (elevational); and average total registration error (TRE) was 1.84 mm (axial), 0.89 mm (lateral) and 3.31 mm (elevational). Clinical results showed a similar FRE to that in the phantom study, but with an average TRE of 14.04 mm (over three patients). Ultimate alignment of the organ boundaries was affected mainly by motion from respiration.

CONCLUSIONS: The small loss of image quality from the fiducial stand-off pad and the minimal inconvenience of using the pad at the time of the CT scan may be a worthwhile trade-off for purposes of registration since the pad provides a registration accuracy of several millimeters while still allowing subsequent feature-based registration. Future research will focus on using the registration from the fiducial stand-off pad for deformable feature-based registration of 3D ultrasound to CT for tumor localization in renal surgery.},

abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) tracking is highly relevant for many computer assisted interventions. This is in particular due to the fact that the scientific community has not yet developed a general solution for tracking of flexible instruments within the human body. Electromagnetic tracking solutions are highly attractive for minimally invasive procedures, since they do not require line of sight. However, a major problem with EM tracking solutions is that they do not provide uniform accuracy throughout the tracking volume and the desired, highest accuracy is often only achieved close to the center of tracking volume. In this paper, we present a solution to the tracking problem, by mounting an EM field generator onto a robot arm. Proposing a new tracking paradigm, we take advantage of the electromagnetic tracking to detect the sensor within a specific sub-volume, with known and optimal accuracy. We then use the more accurate and robust robot positioning for obtaining uniform accuracy throughout the tracking volume. Such an EM servoing methodology guarantees optimal and uniform accuracy, by allowing us to always keep the tracked sensor close to the center of the tracking volume. In this paper, both dynamic accuracy and accuracy distribution within the tracking volume are evaluated using optical tracking as ground truth. In repeated evaluations, the proposed method was able to reduce the overall error from 6.64±7.86 mm to a significantly improved accuracy of 3.83±6.43 mm. In addition, the combined system provides a larger tracking volume, which is only limited by the reach of the robot and not the much smaller tracking volume defined by the magnetic field generator.},

When flexible needles are inserted in soft tissue, these needles generally follow a curved path. Segmenting the trajectory of the needles in ultrasound images will facilitate guiding them within the tissue. In this paper, a novel algorithm for curved needle segmentation in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images is presented. The algorithm is based on the projection of a filtered 3D image onto a two-dimensional (2D) image. Detection of the needle in the resulting 2D image determines a surface on which the needle is located. The needle is then segmented on the surface. The proposed technique is able to detect needles without any previous assumption about the needle shape, or any a priori knowledge about the needle insertion axis line.},

In several situations of the MRI/TRUS fusion guided biopsy, it is important to know the exact location of the deployed biopsy needle, which is imaged in the TRUS video. In this paper, we present a method to automatically detect and segment the biopsy needle in TRUS. To achieve this goal, we propose to combine information from multiple resources, including ultrasound probe stability, TRUS video background model, and the prior knowledge of needle orientation and position. The proposed algorithm was tested on TRUS video sequences which have in total more than 25,000 frames. The needle deployments were successfully detected and segmented in the sequences with high accuracy and low false-positive detection rate.},

abstract = {Ultrasound guidance is used for many surgical interventions such as biopsy and electrode insertion. We present a method to localize a thin surgical tool such as a biopsy needle or a microelectrode in a 3-D ultrasound image. The proposed method starts with thresholding and model fitting using random sample consensus for robust localization of the axis. Subsequent local optimization refines its position. Two different tool image models are presented: one is simple and fast and the second uses learned a priori information about the tool's voxel intensities and the background. Finally, the tip of the tool is localized by finding an intensity drop along the axis. The simulation study shows that our algorithm can localize the tool at nearly real-time speed, even using a MATLAB implementation, with accuracy better than 1 mm. In an experimental comparison with several alternative localization methods, our method appears to be the fastest and the most robust one. We also show the results on real 3-D ultrasound data from a PVA cryogel phantom, turkey breast, and breast biopsy.},

abstract = {Image guidance promises to improve targeting accuracy and broaden the scope of medical procedures performed with needles. This paper takes a step toward automating the guidance of a flexible tip-steerable needle as it is inserted into human tissue. We build upon a previously proposed nonholonomic model of needles that derive steering from asymmetric bevel forces at the tip. The bevel-tip needle is inserted and rotated at its base in order to steer it in six degrees of freedom. As a first step for control, we show that the needle tip can be automatically guided to a planar slice of tissue as it is inserted. Our approach keeps the physician in the loop to control insertion speed. The distance of the needle tip position from the plane of interest is used to drive an observer-based feedback controller which we prove is locally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations demonstrate a large domain of attraction and robustness of the controller in the face of parametric uncertainty and measurement noise. Physical experiments with tip-steerable Nitinol needles inserted into a transparent plastisol tissue phantom under stereo image guidance validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Ultrasound image guidance of interventional devices during minimally invasive surgery provides the clinician with improved soft tissue contrast while reducing ionizing radiation exposure. One problem with ultrasound image guidance is poor visualization of the device tip during the clinical procedure. We have described previously guidance of several interventional devices using a real-time 3-D (RT3-D) ultrasound system with 3-D color Doppler combined with the ColorMark technology. We then developed an analytical model for a vibrating needle to maximize the tip vibrations and improve the reliability and sensitivity of our technique. In this paper, we use the analytical model and improved radiofrequency (RF) and color Doppler filters to detect two different vibrating devices in water tank experiments as well as in an in vivo canine experiment. We performed water tank experiments with four different 3- D transducers: a 5 MHz transesophageal (TEE) probe, a 5 MHz transthoracic (TTE) probe, a 5 MHz intracardiac catheter (ICE) transducer, and a 2.5 MHz commercial TTE probe. Each transducer was used to scan an aortic graft suspended in the water tank. An atrial septal puncture needle and an endomyocardial biopsy forceps, each vibrating at 1.3 kHz, were inserted into the vascular graft and were tracked using 3-D color Doppler. Improved RF and wall filters increased the detected color Doppler sensitivity by 14 dB. In three simultaneous planes from the in vivo 3-D scan, we identified both the septal puncture needle and the biopsy forceps within the right atrium using the 2.5 MHz probe. A new display filter was used to suppress the unwanted flash artifact associated with physiological motion.},

abstract = {Real-time needle segmentation and tracking is very important in image-guided surgery, biopsy, and therapy. Due to its robustness to the addition of extraneous noise, the Hough Transform is one of the most powerful line-detection techniques nowadays and has been widely used in different areas. Unfortunately, its high computation needs often prevent it from being applied in real-time applications without the help of specially designed hardware. In order to solve this problem, a variety of fast implementation algorithms have been proposed. However, none of them can be performed in a real time on an affordable computer. In this paper, we describe a fast implementation of the Hough Transform based on coarse-fine search and the determination of the optimal image resolution. Compared to conventional techniques, our approach decreases the time for needle segmentation by an order of magnitude. Experiments with agar phantom and patient breast biopsy ultrasound (US) image sequences showed that our approach can segment the biopsy needle in real time (i.e., less than 33 ms) on an affordable PC computer without the help of specially designed hardware with the angular rms error of about 1degrees and the position rms error of about 0.5 mm.

abstract = {PURPOSE: In this paper, we present a system capable of automatically steering bevel tip flexible needles under ultrasound guidance toward stationary and moving targets in gelatin phantoms and biological tissue while avoiding stationary and moving obstacles. We use three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound to track the needle tip during the procedure.

METHODS: Our system uses a fast sampling-based path planner to compute and periodically update a feasible path to the target that avoids obstacles. We then use a novel control algorithm to steer the needle along the path in a manner that reduces the number of needle rotations, thus reducing tissue damage. We present experimental results for needle insertion procedures for both stationary and moving targets and obstacles for up to 90 mm of needle insertion.

RESULTS: We obtained a mean targeting error of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] mm in gelatin-based phantom and biological tissue, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: The achieved submillimeter accuracy suggests that our approach is sufficient to target the smallest lesions ([Formula: see text] 2 mm) that can be detected using state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging systems.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Automatic identification of the biopsy-core tissue location during a prostate biopsy procedure would provide verification that targets were adequately sampled and would allow for appropriate intraprocedure biopsy target modification. Localization of the biopsy core requires accurate segmentation of the biopsy needle and needle tip from transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy images. A temporal-based TRUS needle segmentation algorithm was developed specifically for the prostate biopsy procedure to automatically identify the TRUS image containing the biopsy needle from a collection of 2D TRUS images and to segment the biopsy-core location from the 2D TRUS image. METHODS: The temporal-based segmentation algorithm performs a temporal analysis on a series of biopsy TRUS images collected throughout needle insertion and withdrawal. Following the identification of points of needle insertion and retraction, the needle axis is segmented using a Hough transform-based algorithm, which is followed by a temporospectral TRUS analysis to identify the biopsy-needle tip. Validation of the temporal-based algorithm is performed on 108 TRUS biopsy sequences collected from the procedures of ten patients. The success of the temporal search to identify the proper images was manually assessed, while the accuracies of the needle-axis and needle-tip segmentations were quantitatively compared to implementations of two other needle segmentation algorithms within the literature. RESULTS: The needle segmentation algorithm demonstrated a >99\% accuracy in identifying the TRUS image at the moment of needle insertion from the collection of real-time TRUS images throughout the insertion and withdrawal of the biopsy needle. The segmented biopsy-needle axes were accurate to within 2.3 2.0 degrees and 0.48 0.42 mm of the gold standard. Identification of the needle tip to within half of the biopsy-core length (<10 mm) was 95\% successful with a mean error of 2.4 4.0 mm. Needle-tip detection using the temporal-based algorithm was significantly more accurate (p < 0.001) than the other two algorithms tested, while the segmentation of the needle axis was not significantly different between the three algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: The temporal-based needle segmentation algorithm accurately segments the location of the biopsy core from 2D TRUS images of clinical prostate biopsy procedures. The results for needle-tip localization demonstrated that the temporal-based algorithm is significantly more accurate than implementations of some existing needle segmentation algorithms within the literature.},

abstract = {Robotic needle steering is a promising technique to improve the effectiveness of needle-based clinical procedures, such as biopsies and ablation, by computer-controlled, curved insertions of needles within solid organs. In this paper, we explore the capabilities, challenges, and clinical relevance of asymmetric-tip needle steering through experiments in ex vivo and in vivo tissue. We evaluate the repeatability of needle insertion in inhomogeneous biological tissue and compare ex vivo and in vivo needle curvature and insertion forces. Steerable needles curved more in kidney than in liver and prostate, likely due to differences in tissue properties. Pre-bent needles produced higher insertion forces in liver and more curvature in vivo than ex vivo. When compared to straight stainless steel needles, steerable needles did not cause a measurable increase in tissue damage and did not exert more force during insertion. The minimum radius of curvature achieved by prebent needles was 5.23 cm in ex vivo tissue, and 10.4 cm in in vivo tissue. The curvatures achieved by bevel tip needles were negligible for in vivo tissue. The minimum radius of curvature for bevel tip needles in ex vivo tissue was 16.4 cm; however, about half of the bevel tip needles had negligible curvatures. We also demonstrate a potential clinical application of needle steering by targeting and ablating overlapping regions of cadaveric canine liver.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intracerebral drug delivery using surgically placed microcatheters is a growing area of interest for potential treatment of a wide variety of neurological diseases, including tumors, neurodegenerative disorders, trauma, epilepsy, and stroke. Current catheter placement techniques are limited to straight trajectories. The development of an inexpensive system for flexible percutaneous intracranial navigation may be of significant clinical benefit.

OBJECTIVE: Utilizing duty-cycled spinning of a flexible bevel-tipped needle, the authors devised and tested a means of achieving nonlinear trajectories for the navigation of catheters in the brain, which may be applicable to a wide variety of neurological diseases.

METHODS: Exploiting the bending tendency of bevel-tipped needles due to their asymmetry, the authors devised and tested a means of generating curvilinear trajectories by spinning a needle with a variable duty cycle (ie, in on-off fashion). The technique can be performed using image guidance, and trajectories can be adjusted intraoperatively via joystick. Fifty-eight navigation trials were performed during cadaver testing to demonstrate the efficacy of the needle-steering system and to test its precision.

RESULTS: The needle-steering system achieved a target acquisition error of 2 ± 1 mm, while demonstrating the ability to reach multiple targets from one burr hole using trajectories of varying curvature.

CONCLUSION: The accuracy of the needle-steering system was demonstrated in a cadaveric model. Future studies will determine the safety of the device in vivo.},

abstract = {This article proposes a robust technique for needle detection and tracking using three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US). It is difficult for radiologists to detect and follow the position of micro tools, such as biopsy needles, that are inserted in human tissues under 3D US guidance. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a method that automatically reduces the processed volume to a limited region of interest (ROI), increasing at the same time the calculation speed and the robustness of the proposed technique. First, a line filter method that enhances the contrast of the needle against the background is used to facilitate the initialization of ROI using the tubularness information of the complete US volume. Then, the random sample consensus (RANSAC) and Kalman filter (RK) algorithm is used in the ROI to detect and track the precise position of the needle. A series of numerical inhomogeneous phantoms with a needle simulated from real 3D US volumes are used to evaluate our method. The results show that the proposed method is much more robust than the RANSAC algorithm when detecting the needle, regardless of whether or not the insertion axis corresponds to an acquisition plane in the 3D US volume. The possibility of failure is also discussed in this article.},

Some of these procedures have a high degree of difficulty because of poor observability of the needle in the ultrasound image. There have been recent efforts to improve guidance by computer assisted needle detection. These software techniques are often limited by not representing needle curvature. We present two methods to detect the needle in 2D ultrasound that specifically address needle curvature. Firstly, we demonstrate a real-time needle segmentation algorithm based on the Hough transform which detects the needle and represents its curved shape. Secondly, we demonstrate how a new coordinate transformation can transform detection of a curved needle to a linear fit. These methods are demonstrated on ultrasound and photographic images.},

abstract = {Ultrasound guidance of interventional devices during minimally invasive surgical procedures has been investigated by many researchers. Previously, we extended the methods used by the Colormark tracking system to several interventional devices using a real-time, three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound system. These results showed that we needed to improve the efficiency and reliability of the tracking. In this paper, we describe an analytical model to predict the transverse vibrations along the length of an atrial septal puncture needle to enable design improvements of the tracking system. We assume the needle can be modeled as a hollow bar with a circular cross section with a fixed proximal end and a free distal end that is suspended vertically to ignore gravity effects. The initial results show an ability to predict the natural nodes and antinodes along the needle using the characteristic equation for free vibrations. Simulations show that applying a forcing function to the device at a natural antinode yields an order of magnitude larger vibration than when driving the device at a node. Pulsed wave spectral Doppler data was acquired along the distal portion of the needle in a water tank using a 2-D matrix array transesophageal echocardiography probe. This data was compared to simulations of forced vibrations from the model. These initial results suggest that the model is a good first order approximation of the vibrating device in a water tank. It is our belief that knowing the location of the natural nodes and antinodes will improve our ability to drive the device to ensure the vibrations at the proximal end will reach the tip of the device, which in turn should improve our ability to track the device in vivo.},

Using the projection direction and detected 2D needle direction, a plane containing the needle, called the needle plane, is determined. Secondly, the 3D image is projected in the direction perpendicular to the normal of the needle plane and Step 1 is repeated. If the needle direction in the projected image is horizontal, the needle plane is correct, otherwise Steps 1 \& 2 are repeated until a correct needle plane has been found. Thirdly, the 3D image is projected along the normal direction of the needle plane. In this projected image, we determine the endpoints of the needle in the projection coordinates. Then, using the relationship between the projection coordinates and the 3D image coordinates, we determine the end points of the needle in the 3D US image.

abstract = {In the past decade ultrasound (US) has become the preferred modality for a number of interventional procedures, offering excellent soft tissue visualization. The main limitation however is limited visualization of surgical tools. A new method is proposed for robust 3D tracking and US image enhancement of surgical tools under US guidance. Small US sensors are mounted on existing surgical tools. As the imager emits acoustic energy, the electrical signal from the sensor is analyzed to reconstruct its 3D coordinates. These coordinates can then be used for 3D surgical navigation, similar to current day tracking systems. A system with real-time 3D tool tracking and image enhancement was implemented on a commercial ultrasound scanner and 3D probe. Extensive water tank experiments with a tracked 0.2mm sensor show robust performance in a wide range of imaging conditions and tool position/orientations. The 3D tracking accuracy was 0.36 +/- 0.16mm throughout the imaging volume of 55 degrees x 27 degrees x 150mm. Additionally, the tool was successfully tracked inside a beating heart phantom. This paper proposes an image enhancement and tool tracking technology with sub-mm accuracy for US-guided interventions. The technology is non-disruptive, both in terms of existing clinical workflow and commercial considerations, showing promise for large scale clinical impact.},

The algorithm uses a form of the generalized Radon transform to search for long straight objects in the ultrasound image, a feature characteristic of instruments and not found in cardiac tissue. When combined with passive markers placed on the instrument shaft, the full position and orientation of the instrument is found in 3D space. This detection technique is amenable to rapid execution on the current generation of personal computer graphics processor units (GPU). Our GPU implementation detected a surgical instrument in 31 ms, sufficient for real-time tracking at the 25 volumes per second rate of the ultrasound machine. A water tank experiment found instrument orientation errors of 1.1 degrees and tip position errors of less than 1.8mm.

Our method explicitly considers uncertainty in needle motion due to patient differences and the difficulty in predicting needle/tissue interaction. The planner computes optimal steering actions to maximize the probability that the needle will reach the desired target. Given a medical image with segmented obstacles and target, our method formulates the planning problem as a Markov Decision Process based on an efficient discretization of the state space, models motion uncertainty using probability distributions, and computes optimal steering actions using Dynamic Programming. This approach only requires parameters that can be directly extracted from images, allows fast computation of the optimal needle entry point, and enables intra-operative optimal steering of the needle using the pre-computed dynamic programming look-up table. We apply the method to generate motion plans for steerable needles to reach targets inaccessible to stiff needles, and we illustrate the importance of considering uncertainty during motion plan optimization.},

CONCLUSION: Subtle abnormalities on gray-scale sonograms often are better appreciated and understood when the color comet-tail artifact is present. This artifact often is helpful in situations in which gray-scale imaging does not provide adequate information for a conclusive diagnosis. Visualization of the color comet-tail artifact can improve diagnostic confidence in a wide spectrum of clinical conditions encountered in sonographic practice.},

abstract = {Ultrasound imaging has been used for performing single-injection peripheral nerve blocks and continuous catheters. One limitation with current technology is the inability to confirm the location of the needle or catheter tip. We describe a new needle and catheter design that permits distal tip visualization using color flow Doppler. An 18-gauge 100-mm insulated Tuohy needle and a 20-gauge 50-mm polyamide catheter (open tip) with a Teflon-coated steel stylet (B. Braun, Bethlehem, PA) were customized by adhering in place two piezoelectric actuators. These created 1-8 kHz vibrations when coupled to a function generator (FG502, Tektronix, Richardson, TX) and a 100 W audio amplifier (R3000, KLH, Sun Valley, CA). Mimicking a lateral popliteal fossa block, the needle and catheter were inserted into the leg of an unembalmed cadaver. When activated, the tip of each was highlighted in color when scanned in the short axis using the color Doppler mode of a two-dimensional ultrasound and a 12 MHz L38 probe (MicroMaxx, Sonosite, Bothell, WA). Vibration technology may be a useful adjunct while performing ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia. Further study evaluating its usefulness and safety in live tissue is warranted.},

abstract = {The success rate of medical procedures involving needle insertion is often directly related to needle placement accuracy. Due to inherent limitations of commonly used freehand needle placement techniques, there is a need for a system providing for controlled needle steering for procedures that demand high positional accuracy. This paper describes a robotic system developed for flexible needle steering inside soft tissues under real-time ultrasound imaging. An inverse kinematics algorithm based on a virtual spring model is applied to calculate needle base manipulations required for the tip to follow a curved trajectory while avoiding physiological obstacles. The needle tip position is derived from ultrasound images and is used in calculations to minimize the tracking error, enabling a closed-loop needle insertion. In addition, as tissue stiffness is a necessary input to the control algorithm, a novel method to classify tissue stiffness from localized tissue displacements is proposed and shown to successfully distinguish between soft and stiff tissue. The system performance was experimentally verified by robotic manipulation of the needle base inside a phantom with layers of varying stiffnesses. The closed-loop experiment with updated tissue stiffness parameters demonstrated a needle-tip tracking error of approximately 1 mm and proved to be significantly more accurate than the freehand method.},

@article{Harmat2006,
abstract = {Power Doppler ultrasound is used to localize the tip of a needle by detecting physical vibrations. Two types of vibrations are investigated, lateral and axial. The lateral vibrations are created by rotating a stylet, whose tip is slightly bent, inside a stationary cannula while the stylet is completely within the cannula. The minute deflection at the needle tip when rotated causes tissue motion. The axial vibration is induced by extending and retracting a straight stylet inside a stationary cannula. The stylet's tip makes contact with the tissue and causes it to move. The lateral vibration method was found to perform approximately the same under a variety of configurations (e.g., different insertion angles and depths) and better than the axial vibration method. Tissue stiffness affects the performance of the lateral vibration method, but good images can be obtained through proper tuning of the ultrasound machine.},

Based on a stochastic model of needle steering, the probability density function for the needle tip pose is approximated as a Gaussian. The means and covariances are estimated using an error propagation algorithm which has second order accuracy. Then we adapt the path-of-probability (POP) algorithm to path planning of flexible needles with bevel tips. We demonstrate how our planning algorithm can be used for feedback control of flexible needles. We also derive a closed-form solution for the port placement problem for finding good insertion locations for flexible needles in the case when there are no obstacles. Furthermore, we propose a new method using reference splines with the POP algorithm to solve the path planning problem for flexible needles in more general cases that include obstacles.},

@article{Barva2008,
abstract = {In surgical practice, small metallic instruments are frequently used to perform various tasks inside the human body. We address the problem of their accurate localization in the tissue. Recent experiments using medical ultrasound have shown that this modality is suitable for real-time visualization of anatomical structures as well as the position of surgical instruments. We propose an image-processing algorithm that permits automatic estimation of the position of a line-segment-shaped object. This method was applied to the localization of a thin metallic electrode in biological tissue. We show that the electrode axis can be found through maximizing the parallel integral projection transform that is a form of the Radon transform. To accelerate this step, hierarchical mesh-grid algorithm is implemented. Once the axis position is known, localization of the electrode tip is performed. The method was tested on simulated images, on ultrasound images of a tissue mimicking phantom containing a metallic electrode, and on real ultrasound images from breast biopsy. The results indicate that the algorithm is robust with respect to variations in electrode position and speckle noise. Localization accuracy is of the order of hundreds of micrometers and is comparable to the ultrasound system axial resolution.},
