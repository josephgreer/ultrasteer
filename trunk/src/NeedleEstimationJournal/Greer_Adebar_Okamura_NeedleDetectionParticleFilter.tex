\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{C}{ontinuous} state estimation of a steerable needle for closed loop control using freehand 2D Doppler ultrasound.

\section{Probabilistic State Estimation}
\begin{figure}[!t]

\end{figure}

In this work, the state estimation problem for steerable needles is formulated in the Bayesian Filtering framework described in \cite{Thrun:2005}.
\begin{align}  \label{eqn:stateest}
&\underbrace{\stateest}_{\text{current state estimate}} = \eta \underbrace{\motion}_{\text{motion model}} \underbrace{\meas}_{\text{measurement model}}
\end{align}
The left side of equation (\ref{eqn:stateest}) is a probability distribution representing the needle's state, $\bvar{x}{k}$.  With certain independence assumptions for the needle's states and measurements \cite{Thrun:2005}, this probability distribution can be decomposed into two distributions. Each component distribution of the state estimate can be computed in an efficient manner:  a motion model describes how the system responds to input $\bvar{u}{k}$, and a measurement model captures the distribution of measurements one would expect given the system's state.   In practice, we implement the Bayesian filtering using a particle filter \cite{Thrun:2005}.


\subsection{Needle Steering State} \label{subsec:state}
Figure \ref{fig_nk} provides a diagram of the unicycle kinematic model for needle steering.  In this model, the state of the system $\bvar{x}{k} =  \left[\vec{p}_k, R_k\right]^\top$ is completely defined by the position of the needle tip, $\vec{p}_k$ and the orientation of a frame attached to the needle tip, $R_k = \left[\hat{x}_k,\hat{y}_k,\hat{z}_k\right] \in \text{SO(3)}$.  For state estimation, we augment the unicycle kinematic state with the ultrasound transducer position and orientation, $\usorientation$ and $\uspos$.  This information is provided by an electromagnetic tracker which is fixed to the ultrasound transducer.  Finally,  we also augment the unicycle kinematic model state with the $N$ most recent command inputs $\bvar{u}{k-1...k-N}$.  This makes it possible to estimate the shaft's position and orientation, which is important for the measurement model described in section \ref{subsec:measurement} below.
\begin{dmath*}
\bvar{x}{k} =  \left[\underbrace{\vec{p}_k,}_{\text{tip pos.}} \underbrace{R_k,}_{\text{tip orientation}} \underbrace{\vec{p}_{\text{us}},}_{\text{transducer pos.}} \underbrace{R_{\text{us}},}_{\text{transducer orientation}} \underbrace{\bvar{u}{k-1,...,k-N}}_{\text{previous commands}}\right]^\top
\end{dmath*}


\subsection{Motion Model} \label{subsec:unicycle}
In this work, we use the unicycle kinematic model proposed in \cite{Park2005}.  This model has previously been used and validated for closed loop control of steerable needles in \cite{Majewicz2013} and \cite{adebar2014recursive}.  In the unicycle kinematic model, steerable needles are assumed to naturally follow circular paths of constant curvature in a plane determined by the orientation and position of the needle's tip.  Control of the needle is achieved through two degrees of freedom, insertion and rotation of the needle about its axis.

In \cite{adebar2014recursive}, a stochastic state update equation,
\begin{equation*}
\bvar{x}{k+1} = f(\bvar{x}{k}, \bvar{u}{k}, \bvar{w}{k})
\end{equation*}  
was described for the unicycle kinematic model, where $\bvar{x}{k+1}$ is the needle's state at time-step $k+1$. $\bvar{u}{k}$ and $\bvar{w}{k}$ are the control and disturbance vectors at time $k$ and are described below.  

At each time-step, the needle is rotated about its axis by $\delta \theta_k$ and inserted a distance $l_k$.  These actions define the control input 
\begin{equation*}
\bvar{u}{k} = \left[l_k, \delta\theta_k\right]^\top
\end{equation*}  

During an insertion, the unicycle kinematic model assumes the needle will travel along a circular arc.  The radius of curvature of this arc, $\rho$, is assumed to be constant and is governed by the stiffness of both the tissue and needle.  

A state update is first calculated assuming no process noise, producing a new ideal state, $\bvar{x}{k+1}^{\text{ideal}} = \left[\vec{p}^{\text{ideal}}_{k+1}, R^{\text{ideal}}_{k+1}\right]$.  This is done by rotating the coordinate frame attached to the needle tip, $R_k$, about $\hat{z}_k$ by $\delta \theta$ radians to yield an intermediate frame $R' = [\hat{x}', \hat{y}', \hat{z}']$:
\begin{equation*}
R' = R_{\hat{z}_k}(\delta\theta)R_k
\end{equation*}
In the plane defined by intermediate tip frame axes $\hat{y}'_k$ and $\hat{z}'_k$, the tip position is moved along a $\frac{l_k}{\rho}$ radian arc segment of length $l_k$ to yield a new tip position, $\vec{p}^{\text{ideal}}_{k+1}$.  Finally, $R'$ is rotated by $\frac{l_k}{\rho}$ radians about $\hat{x}'$ to yield an updated coordinate frame
\begin{equation*}
R^{\text{ideal}}_{k+1} = [\hat{x}^{\text{ideal}}_k, \hat{y}^{\text{ideal}}_k, \hat{z}^{\text{ideal}}_k] = R_{\hat{x}'_k}\left(\frac{l_k}{\rho}\right)R'
\end{equation*}
so that $\hat{z}^{\text{ideal}}_{k+1}$ is tangent with the ideal needle's trajectory at time $k+1$.  

The ideal needle state update described above has error from both inaccuracies in the kinematic model as well as disturbances such as tissue in-homogeneity, vasculature, and tissue fascia.  Because of this, the ideal unicycle kinematic model was modified in \cite{adebar2014recursive} to account for error in both position and orientation.  These errors are captured in the process noise random variable 
\begin{equation*}
\bvar{w}{k} = \left[\vec{w}_{p_k}, W_{R_k}\right]
\end{equation*}  
which has a position noise component, $\vec{w}_{p_k}$ and an orientation noise component, $W_{R_k}$.  $\vec{w}_{p_k}$ is added to $\vec{p}^{\text{ideal}}_{k+1}$ to yield the final position $\vec{p}_{k+1}$.
Similarly, the orientation noise component perturbs $R^{ideal}_{k+1}$ to yield the final orientation $R_{k+1}$
\begin{align*}
\vec{p}_{k+1} &= \vec{p}^{\text{ideal}}_{k+1}+\vec{w}_{p_k} \\
R_{k+1} &= W_{R_k}R^{\text{ideal}}_{k+1}
\end{align*}
With the stochastic state update function, $f$, an estimate of the probability of being in state $x_k$ can be calculated given a previous state, action, and disturbance.  Therefore the motion model can be calculated as 
\begin{align*}
& p(\bvar{x}{k} \mid \bvar{x}{k-1},\bvar{u}{k}) = \int_{\bvar{x}{k-1}} p(X_k = \bvar{x}{k} \mid u_k, \bvar{x}{k-1}) \mathrm{d}\bvar{x}{k-1}
\end{align*}
In practice, the motion model distribution is approximated in the particle filter by sampling $\motion$ repeatedly, which is straightforward, given $f$.
\subsection{Measurement Model} \label{subsec:measurement}
\begin{figure}[]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{Figures/NeedleMeasurements.pdf}
\caption{Needle Measurement Model}
\label{fig_mm}
\end{figure}
It is assumed that the ultrasound transducer is positioned so that ultrasound image plane is near the needle tip, but not on it.  In other words, the needle tip is not directly observed.  Nevertheless, by using the unicycle kinematic model and command history, hypothesis needle tip states can be propagated backward in time to shaft positions.  Because of this, measurements of the needle shaft indirectly provide information about the needle tip.

In this work, a combination of Doppler and B-mode images from a tracked 2D transducer are used for sensing the steerable needle.  As described in section \ref{sec:imageproc}, each image is processed to produce a measurement
\begin{dmath*}
\bvar{z}{k} = \left[\underbrace{x_{\text{im}},y_{\text{im}},}_{\text{image coords.}} \underbrace{d}_{\text{Doppler response}}\right]^\top
\end{dmath*}
Figure \ref{fig_mm} illustrates the components of a measurement, $\bvar{z}{k}$.  $\imcoords$ represents the estimated intersection of the needle shaft and ultrasound plane in image coordinates and $d$ is the Doppler response corresponding to the intersection.

The measurement model can be explicitly written as $\meas = p(x_{\text{im}}, y_{\text{im}}, d \mid \bvar{x}{k})$.  It is assumed that the probability of a Doppler response is independent of shaft measurement location, so that the measurement model can be decomposed into a Doppler probability and image location probability, which are calculated separately. 
\begin{align*}
p(x_{\text{im}}, y_{\text{im}}, d \mid \bvar{x}{k}) = p(d \mid \bvar{x}{k}) p(x_{\text{im}}, y_{\text{im}} \mid \bvar{x}{k})
\end{align*}

The image location probability provides information about the needle tip's orientation, lateral position, and radius of curvature.  Let $\shaftcoords$ be the coordinates that locate the point of intersection between the needle shaft and image plane in image coordinates.  Given $\bvar{x}{k}$, $\shaftcoords$ can be calculated by first propagating the needle tip and orientation, $\vec{p}_k, R_k$, backward through the unicycle kinematic model until the shaft segment between two time-steps intersects the image plane.  This is done using command history $\bvar{u}{k-1,...,k-N}$.  The point of intersection is converted to image coordinates using $\uspos$ and $\usorientation$.  It is assumed the location measurement $\left[x_{\text{im}}, y_{\text{im}}\right]^\top = \shaftcoords + \vec{w}_{\text{im}}$ where $\vec{w}_{\text{im}} \sim \mathcal{N}(\vec{0}, \sigma_{\text{im}}^2 I)$.  This implies
\begin{equation*}
p(x_{\text{im}},y_{\text{im}}) = 
\end{equation*}
