\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{C}{ontinuous} state estimation of a steerable needle for closed loop control using freehand 2D Doppler ultrasound.

\section{Methods}

Repeat MICCAI paper.

\subsection{Kinematic Model}
\begin{figure}[!t]

\label{fig_nk}
\end{figure}

In this work, we use the unicycle kinematic model proposed in \cite{Park2005}.  This model has previously been used and validated for closed loop control of steerable needles in \cite{Majewicz2013} and \cite{adebar2014recursive}.  In the unicycle kinematic model, steerable needles are assumed to naturally follow circular paths of constant curvature in a plane determined by the orientation and position of the needle's tip.  Control of the needle is achieved through two degrees of freedom, insertion and rotation of the needle about its axis.

\subsubsection{Needle Steering State}
Figure \ref{fig_nk} provides a diagram of the unicycle kinematic model for needle steering.  At an arbitrary time-step, $k$, the state of the system, $\mathbf{x}_k = \left[\vec{p}_k, R_k\right]^\top$ is completely defined by the position of the needle tip, $\vec{p}_k$ and the orientation of a frame attached to the needle tip, $R_k = \left[\hat{x}_k,\hat{y}_k,\hat{z}_k\right]$.

\subsubsection{Stochastic State Update}
In \cite{adebar2014recursive}, a stochastic state update equation,
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = f(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k, \mathbf{w}_k)
\end{equation*}  
was described for the unicycle kinematic model, where $\mathbf{x}_{k+1}$ is the needle's state at time-step $k+1$. $\mathbf{u}_k$ and $\mathbf{w}_k$ are the control and disturbance vectors at time $k$ and are described below.  

At each time-step, the needle is rotated about its axis by $\delta \theta_k$ and inserted a distance $l_k$.  These actions define the control input 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{u}_k = \left[l_k, \delta\theta_k\right]^\top
\end{equation*}  

During an insertion, the unicycle kinematic model assumes the needle will travel along a circular arc.  The radius of curvature of this arc, $\rho$ is assumed to be constant and is affected by the stiffness of both the tissue and needle.  

$\mathbf{x}_{k+1}$ is calculated by first rotating the coordinate frame attached the needle tip, $R_k$, about $\hat{z}_k$ by $\delta \theta$ to yield an intermediate frame $R' = [\hat{x}', \hat{y}', \hat{z}']$.  The needle tip position is then moved along a $l_k/\rho$ radian arc of length $l_k$ to yield a new tip position, $\vec{p}_{k+1}$.  Finally, $R'$ is rotated by $\l_k/\rho$ about $\hat{x}'$ to yield an updated coordinate frame, $R_{k+1}$ so that $\hat{z}_{k+1}$ is tangent with the needle's trajectory at time $k+1$.
