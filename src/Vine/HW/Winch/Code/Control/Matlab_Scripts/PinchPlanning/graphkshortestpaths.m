function [ DIST, PATH ] = graphkshortestpaths( G, S, T, K )
%
% [ DIST, PATH ] = graphkshortestpaths( G, S, T, K ) determines the K shortest paths from node S
% to node T. weights of the edges are all positive entries in the n-by-n adjacency matrix
% represented by the sparse matrix G. DIST are the K distances from S to T; PATH is a cell array
% with the K shortest paths themselves.
%
% the shortest path algorithm used is Dijkstra's algorithm (graphshortestpath).
